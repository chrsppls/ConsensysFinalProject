#Design Patterns

This contract contains a self-destruct function which is only accessible by the owner.

In addition the contract contains a withdrawal pattern and requirements around transfering funds from investors to investees.

Other patterns such as name registry, mapping iterator, and factory contracts were limited in this version of the contract.
